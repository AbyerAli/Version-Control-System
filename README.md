# Version-Control-System
a really simple implementation of VCS with very minimal features including committing the code and reverting to a previous commit.
just compile the program and run standard commands from original git e.g. **git add, git commit, git revert etc**. PS. made this project during my 3rd semester for practicing purpose ;)
